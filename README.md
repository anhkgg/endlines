Did your source code get polluted by scattered `^M`'s ?

Endlines smartly converts text files from and to the following line ending conventions : Unix/Apple (LF), Windows (CRLF) and legacy Apple (CR).

    endlines unix *

- No need to know about the source files' convention. Multiple conventions can be mixed within a single file.
- Straightforward syntax for multiple files and recursion into directories. Hidden files and directories are skipped by default (you don't want to mess with your `.git`, do you ?)
- Binary files will be detected and skipped by default, according to a filter based on both file extension and file content.
- Files' last access and last modified time stamps can be preserved.
- UTF-8 files, UTF-16 with BOM as well as all single byte encodings will be treated well. However, UTF-32 is not supported (files will be seen as binary and left untouched).
- Whether converting or checking, a report is given on the original state of line endings that were found.

```
    $ endlines check -r .
    endlines : dry run, scanning files

    endlines : 6431 files checked ; found :
                  - 142 No line ending
                  - 1 Legacy Mac (CR)
                  - 6250 Unix (LF)
                  - 37 Windows (CR-LF)
                  - 1 Mixed endings
               2403 binaries skipped
               480 hidden files skipped
```

Let the help screen say it all :


      endlines ACTION [OPTIONS] [FILES]

      ACTION can be :
        lf, unix, linux, osx    : convert all endings to LF.
        crlf, windows, win, dos : convert all endings to CR-LF.
        cr, oldmac              : convert all endings to CR.
        check                   : perform a dry run to check current conventions.

      If no files are specified, endlines converts from stdin to stdout.
      Supports UTF-8, UTF-16 with BOM, and all major single byte codesets.

      General   -f / --final    : add final EOL if none.
                -q / --quiet    : silence all but the error messages.
                -v / --verbose  : print more about what's going on.
                --version       : print version and license.

      Files     -b / --binaries : don't skip binary files.
                -h / --hidden   : process hidden files (/directories) too.
                -k / --keepdate : keep last modified and last access times.
                -r / --recurse  : recurse into directories.

      Examples  endlines check *.txt
                endlines linux -k -r aFolder anotherFolder


## Install

### From binaries

The `binaries` folder contains precompiled binaries for Linux/AMD64 and OSX. You can rename the one that fits you to `endlines` and move it to `/usr/local/bin` or to your local path.


### From source

- Local install : `make; make test` ; if satisfied, move the `endlines` executable to your local path.
- Global install : `make; make test; sudo make install` should suffice.



## Operating systems

Endlines is known to have been compiled and run out of the box on Apple OSX, several Linux distributions and IBM AIX. I provide support for all POSIX compliant operating sytems.

Endlines *may* compile and run on Windows provided the proper POSIX header files are available. I won't provide any support for it, but pull requests helping with Windows support will be welcome.


## News

Version 1.9.1 fixes a theoritical corner-case where a read-error during the second pass would not be properly reported, only while the `--final` flag is used.

Versions 1.9 got the "--final" option, outputs normal messages to standard output instead of standard error stream, and allows short flags collapsing.

Versions 1.8.x got safe for concurrent launches.

Version 1.7 embeds the speed and robustness improvements of quickly paced previous versions. I strongly encourage you to upgrade. I removed the tags on purpose. Besides, I don't have a Mac anymore, and this will be the last version that I can compile for OSX by myself. If somebody is willing to provide support with OSX builds, I'll be glad to team up. Please just open an issue.
